One of the appeals, Civil Appeal No. 39 of 1960, arises out of the assessment of income-tax and the other appeal, Civil Appeal No. 40 of' 1960, arises out of the assessment of excess profits tax.",FAC
24,4180,2777,3016,"During the relevant accounting periods the firm entered into certain transactions called ""hedge""
transactions in the billion market at Bhatinda (then a part of the Patiala State, that is, outside: the taxable territories of British India).",FAC
25,4180,3017,3240,"It claimed-that it had incurred losses to non-residents there in the sums of Rs.
6,366/- and Rs. 16,615/- in the said transactions and claimed that these losses should be taken into consideration in determining its 'income.",FAC
26,4180,3241,3500,"It appears from the assessment order of the Income-tax Officer, Delhi, dated January 27, 1949 that the firm purchased certain ""sillies"" (bars of gold and silver) from a Bhatinda party on the telephone, which purchases were later confirmed by a letter or wire.",FAC

34,4180,4379,4487,"The Appellate Tribunal, however, allowed the deduction claimed on grounds which are not very clearly stated.",FAC
35,4180,4488,4899,"It appears; that the Tribunal proceeded on the footing that it was not possible to ,""split up transactions of a business located in the taxable territories into two categories of transactions inside and outside such territories"" and even if such spliting up was possible, the Bhatinda transactions would fall within s. 42 of the Act and the income etc. therefrom would be deemed to have arisen in British India.",FAC
36,4180,4900,5305,"In this view of the matter, the Accountant Member of' the Tribunal who delivered the judgment of the Tribunal said ""To start with, it seems to us that there is no warrant either in terms of s. 14(2)(c) or in terms of the proviso to s. 24(1) to split up the transactions of a business located in the taxable territories into transactions in taxable territories and transactions without taxable territories.",FAC
37,4180,5306,5574,"Even if that treatment were permitted and the profits or losses resulting from transactions outside the taxable territories can be described as income, profits and gains, such income, profits and gains are deemed under s. 42 to have accrued or arisen in British India.",FAC

41,4180,5958,5981,"We allow these losses.""",FAC
42,4180,5981,6031,"
The Tribunal accordingly allowed the two appeals.",FAC
43,4180,6032,6188,We may here state that the Income-tax authorities as also the Tribunal considered the claim for deduction in relation to the assessment for income-tax only.,FAC
44,4180,6189,6401,"As to the excess profits tax there was-no separate discussion of the provisions of S. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 and they dealt with the assessment of excess profits tax as a mere consequential matter.",FAC
45,4180,6401,6577,"
The, Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, then made two applications asking the Tribunal to refer certain questions of law arising out of its orders to the High Court of Punjab,",FAC
46,4180,6578,6692,The Tribunal cam to the conclusion that no questions of law arose out of its orders and rejected the applications.,FAC
47,4180,6693,7300,"The High Court was then moved under s. 66 (2) of the Indian income-tax Act, 1922 and the High, Court heard the two applications together and directed the Tribunal to state a case on the following two questions which, in the opinion of the High Court, arose out of the Tribunal's orders.
          (1) Whether the claim of loss in this case is governed by the provisions of S. 10(1) or 24(1) proviso read with s. 14(2)(c), or by the provisions of s. 42 ?
 (2) Whether on the facts of the case a loss of Rs. 22,981/- is allowable in computing the income of the assessee chargeable to the Excess Profits Tax ?""",RLC
48,4180,7300,7379,"
The Tribunal then' drew up a statement of case on the two questions aforesaid.",RLC
49,4180,7380,7498,"By its judgement and order dated January 23, 1957 the High Court answered both the questions in favour of theassessee.",RLC
50,4180,7499,7705,"Thereafter the Commissioner of Incometax, Delhi, asked for and obtained a certificate under s.66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act and on that certificate the present appeals have been brought to this Court.",FAC
51,4180,7705,8003,"
As to the first question the learned Additional Solicitor- General, appearing on behalf of the appellant, has conceded that him 'not in a, position to dispute the correctness of the answer given, in view of the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Indo-Mercantile Bank Ltd. (1).",ARG_PETITIONER
52,4180,8003,8073,"
This disposes of Civil Appeal No. 39 of 1960 which must be dismissed.",ARG_PETITIONER
53,4180,8073,8144,"
In Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1960 the second question falls for decision.",ANALYSIS
54,4180,8145,9623,"In answering this second question the High Court has proceeded on two grounds : firstly, it has referred to s.5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, particularly the third proviss thereto, and contracting the provisions of that section with s.5 of the Business Profits Tax Act of 1947 has expressed the view that neither of these provisions touched the question whether losses incurred in an Indian State could be taken into account in assessing the taxable income of an assessee in British India for purposes of assessing excess profits tax or business profits tax ; it then referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Karamchand Premchand Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay (2) and said: ""It would seem that inspite of the slightly different language of the Excess Profits Tax Act from that of the Income-tax Act, no distinction has ever been drawn in this matter between the principles governing assessment to income-tax and the principles governing assessment to excess profits tax and in fact it would appear to have been the universal (1) (1959) 36 I.T.R, 1.
(2) (1956)30I.T.R.849,          practice that decisions of the Income-tax authorities and High Courts have been followed by consequential orders relating to the same assessee's taxable income for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the learned counsel for the Commissioner has not been able to cite any decision in which different principles have been applied in this particular matter.",ANALYSIS
55,4180,9624,10138,"Admittedly one of the reasons given in his judgment by Chagla C.J.
          for coming to the decision mentioned above 'was that the third proviso had been changed in the Business Profits Tax Act as compared with the Excess Profit-, Tax Act, but this is only one of a number of reasons and the questions has not been considered at all whether under the proviso in the Excess Profits Tax Act losses made in an Indian State could have been computed in assessing the assessee's income from business in British India.",ANALYSIS
56,4180,10139,10565,"I can only say that in the circumstances it seems to me likely that if the point had arisen the same view that I.
          have expressed above would have been taken, namely, that whereas for the excess profits tax profits earned in an Indian State could not be taken into consideration at all, such profits could be taken into account if brought into taxable territories for assessing profits tax and that is regards losses.",ANALYSIS
57,4180,10566,10691,"they I could be taken into account in assessing the business whether they occurred in a State. or in what was British India.""",ANALYSIS
58,4180,10691,10762,"
The second ground given by the High Court depended on the facts found.",ANALYSIS
59,4180,10763,10909,"The High Court expressed the view that, on the facts found it was doubtful if the losses in question could be deemed to have occurred in Bhatinda.",ANALYSIS
60,4180,10909,11116,"
It said ""It is not in dispute that the only place where the assessee carries on business is Delhi and that its transactions in other markets are carried out by means of commu- nication by telephone or Post.",ANALYSIS
61,4180,11117,11524,"There is no Suggestion that the firm has any agent or branch in any native State and it therefore seems to me that whether profits result or losses are incurred as the result of transac- tions of this kind even with firms in Indian States, the profits accrue or the losses are incurred at the place where the payments are received or from which they are made, namely, the firm's place of business at Delhi.""",ANALYSIS
62,4180,11524,11694,"
On behalf of the appellant it is contended that both the aforesaid grounds given by the High Court for the answer which it gave to the second question are unsubstantial.",ANALYSIS
63,4180,11694,11767,"
The, first ground, it is contended, is untenable in law, and the second.",ANALYSIS
64,4180,11768,11928,"proceeds not on the findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunal but on new findings made by the High Court, which course was not open to the High Court to take.",ANALYSIS
65,4180,11928,11976,"
We consider that these contentions are correct.",ANALYSIS
66,4180,11977,12286,"As to the first ground, it seems clear to us that under the third proviso to s.5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 where the profits etc., of a part of the firm's business accrued or arose it Bhatinda, that part of the, business shall for the purpose of the said section be deemed to be a separate business.",ANALYSIS
67,4180,12287,12383,If that is so the losses which arose at Bhatinda must also be the losses of a separate business.,ANALYSIS

71,4180,13333,13532,"This Court considered s. 5. of the Business Profits Tax Act, 1947 and pointed out the distinction between the third proviso thereto and the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1.940.",PRE_RELIED
72,4180,13533,13884,"This Court quoted. with approval the decision in Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Bombay City v. Bhogilal H. Patel Bombay (2 ) and held that the language used in the third proviso to S. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 was one of exclusion and that Act did not apply to profits etc. of that part of the business which arose in an Indian State.",PRE_RELIED
73,4180,13885,14123,"If that part of the business has to be treated as a separate business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act, it is difficult to see how the losses incurred in an Indian State can be taken into consideration for the same purposes.",ANALYSIS
74,4180,14124,14301,We think that the High Court was in error in thinking that the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act did not touch the question which the High Court had to answer.,ANALYSIS
75,4180,14302,14437,"On the (2) (1952) 21 I.T.R. 72, (1) (1960) 40 I.T.R. 106.contrary, we think that the proviso answers the question against the assessee.",ANALYSIS
76,4180,14438,14491,"Now, as to the second ground given by the High Court.",ANALYSIS
77,4180,14492,14742,"It seems to us that there can be no doubt that the assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that the losses for which the assessee firm claimed a deduction arose and were incurred at Bhatinda, even though the firm's place of business was Delhi.",ANALYSIS
78,4180,14743,14957,"The Income-tax Officer, as also the Appellate Assistant Commissioner referred to s. 14(2)(c ) of the Income-tax Act, 1922; that provision related to income, profit-, or gains accruing or arising in an Indian State.",ANALYSIS
79,4180,14957,15165,"
The assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that as the proof its we are exempt from tax in terms of s.
14(2)(c), the losses arising out-. side the taxable territories could not be taken into account.",ANALYSIS
80,4180,15166,15268,"The Tribunal did not rely on s. 14(2)(c), nor on the proviso to s. 24 (1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922.",ANALYSIS
81,4180,15269,15291,But it relied on s.42.,ANALYSIS
82,4180,15292,15544,"That again shows that it proceeded on the footing that though the income actually arose outside the taxable territories, it should be deemed to have arisen with in the taxable territories by reason of its business connection in the taxable territories.",ANALYSIS
83,4180,15545,15661,The High Court had to answer the second question on the facts found; it could not.arrived at fresh findings of fact.,ANALYSIS
84,4180,15662,15695,Such a course was not open to it.,ANALYSIS
85,4180,15695,15858,"
Indeed, it is true that the Tribunal said that the firm's transactions could not be split up, but the actual decision of the tribunal proceeded on the basis that.",ANALYSIS
86,4180,15859,16096,"even it the transactions could be split up, s.42 applied and the income actually arising at Bhatinda would be deemed to have arisen in the taxable territories and so the losses must be taken into consideration for arriving at the income.",ANALYSIS
87,4180,16097,16194,The Tribunal considered the matter solely from the point of view of the assessment of income-tax.,ANALYSIS
88,4180,16195,16355,"It did not consider the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 and what effect it had in the matter of the assessment of' excess profits tax.",ANALYSIS

526,4196,1635,3719,": The Police Inspector of Women Police Station, Mysuru city has filed the charge sheet against accused for the offences punishable under sections 498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C., Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.
 2. The brief facts of the case of the prosecution are that:- The complainant and accused No.1 married on 09.07.2009 before the Sub-Registrar at Mysuru and thereafter the said marriage was performed before the elders on 20.09.2010 at Kendaganneshwara temple. It is alleged in the complaint that the accused demanded for Rs.10,00,000/- and gold ornaments. The parents of the complainant gave Rs.10,00,000/- and other gold ornaments as per the demand.
It is alleged that the accused No.1 to 3 started harassing the complainant for one or the other reason. The accused abused the complainant in filthy language. The complainant has alleged that the accused subjected her for physical assault.
The accused demanded for further dowry amount from the complainant. Even after receipt of Rs.2,00,000/- after the marriage the accused did not bother to take care of the complainant. It is also alleged that the accused demanded money for the purchase of Zen Car. The accused used to come to the place of work of the complainant and pick up quarrel with her. The complainant was driven out of the house and the gold and silver articles and the amount which was received as dowry by the accused was not returned to the complainant. Hence the complaint is lodged by the complainant against the accused No.1 to 4 before the concerned police. CW.12 has registered the case against the accused. CW.13 has further conducted the investigation and filed the charge sheet against the accused No.1 to 4 for offences punishable U/s.498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C. and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.
 3. The accused No.1 to 4 are on Court bail. The charge framed, read over and explained to the accused. After understanding the charge the accused denied the same and claimed to be tried.
 4. The prosecution has examined PW.1 to 3 and the documents are marked as Ex.P1 to P4.",FAC
527,4196,3927,5421,"6. The points that emerge for consideration are:- 1) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused No.1 being the husband of CW.1 in furtherance of common intention has ill treated the complainant and the accused No.1 to 3 started harassing the complainant and abused the complainant in filthy language and he subjected her for physical assault also even after receipt of Rs.2,00,000/- after the marriage the accused did not bother to take care of the complainant and the accused used to come to the place of work of the complainant and pick up quarrel with her, the complainant was driven out of the house and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C.?
 2) Whether the prosecution further proves beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of marriage, the accused demanded for Rs.10,00,000/- and gold ornaments and the parents of the complainant gave Rs.10,00,000/- and other gold ornaments as per the demand and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3 of Dowry Prohibition Act?
 3) Whether the prosecution further proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused harassed the complainant physically and mentally in demand of money and Even after receipt of Rs.2,00,000/- after the marriage the accused did not bother to take care of the complainant and the accused demanded money for the purchase of Zen Car and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act?

The accused demanded for money to open a shop and a Gym center. Even after compliance of the dowwry the accused harassed the complainant. The accused demanded for Zen Car. The accused also caused harassment to the complainant in her work place. The evidence of PW.1 is totally contrary to the complaint. PW.1 has not deposed in accordance with the contents of the complaint. When the complainant turned hostile and not supported the case of the prosecution she was cross examined by the learned APP.

634,4152,8192,8317,The learned counsel for the appellant says that it is clear from ss. 3 and 4 that a tax under the Madras Act is a yearly tax.,ARG_PETITIONER

637,4152,8691,8923,He says that the taxable event is the last purchase in the State during the assessment year and if stocks are held at the end of the assessment year it follows that the assessee holding the stocks is the last purchaser in the State.,ARG_PETITIONER
638,4152,8923,8969,"
In our opinion, this reasoning is fallacious.",ANALYSIS
639,4152,8970,9402,"It is true that ss. 3 and 4 speak of ""a year"", i.e., the financial year, and it is only the turnover during that year that is liable to taxation in the hands of the assessee, but s. 4 has to be read with the Second Schedule, and reading s. 4 with the Second Schedule, it seems to us clear that a dealer is not liable to pay a tax on the purchases until the purchases acquire the quality of being the last purchases inside the State.",ANALYSIS
640,4152,9403,9673,"In other words, when he files a return and declares the stock in hand, the stock in hand cannot be said to have been acquired by last purchase because he may still during the next assessment year,, sell it or he may consume it himself or the goods may be destroyed, etc.",ANALYSIS
641,4152,9674,9904,He would be entitled to claim before the assessing authorities that the character of acquisition of the stock in hand was undetermined; in the light of subsequent events it may or may not become The last purchase inside the State.,ANALYSIS
642,4152,9904,9982,"
In our view this construction is in consonance with s. 15 of the Central Act.",ANALYSIS
643,4152,9983,10344,"If the argument of the learned counsel for the State were to be accepted it would mean that the States could with impunity levy purchase tax on declared goods at more than one stage, i.e. on purchases in the hands of one dealer during one assessment year and purchases of the same goods in the hands of another dealer in a subsequent assessment year, and so on.",ANALYSIS
644,4152,10345,10585,"Therefore, we agree with the Madras High Court that the assessee is right in contending that he was entitled to claim deduction in respect of the value of the stock of Rs. 2,27,250 as being the purchases other than last purchases of cotton.",ANALYSIS

The judgment under appeal draws a distinction between tax- able event and a stage at which the levy of tax in the case of declared goods is subject to single point levy.",ANALYSIS

651,4152,11712,12031,"In that case the goods could not be assessed in 1960-61 in the hands of the exporting purchaser, because the taxable event did not occur in that year; it could not be assessed in the hands of the seller in 1959-60 because though the taxable event occurred that year, the single point stage was not reached in that year.",ANALYSIS

Argument has then been advanced on behalf of the appellants that Sub Inspector Patil did not make investigation in the case in accordance with law.",ANALYSIS
1088,4211,16219,16498,"It is urged that permission to make investigation was granted to Sub Inspector Patil on November 12, 1966 and, as such, he was not authorized to make before that date the enquiry which led to the registration of the case as that enquiry partook of the character of investigation.",ANALYSIS
1089,4211,16499,16625,Nothing has been brought to our notice as to how an enquiry before the registration of a case can be held to be investigation.,ANALYSIS
1090,4211,16626,16948,"The matter, however, need not be dilated upon and it is not necessary to express any final opinion in the matter because we find that there is no material on the record as may show that the accused were prejudiced because of the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act.",ANALYSIS

1092,4211,17318,17504,The underlying reason for the above dictum is that an illegality committed in the course of investigation does not affect the competence and jurisdiction of the court to try the accused.,ANALYSIS
1093,4211,17505,17835,"Where, therefore, the trial of the case has proceeded to termination, the invalidity of the proceeding investigation would not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a result of the trial unless the illegality in the investigation has caused prejudice to the accused (see H.

For the same reason, we are unable to accede to the contention of Mr. Kotwal that the conviction of the accused should be set aside because permission under section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act to SI Patil for investigation of the offence was granted in a ,casual manner and without the existence of sufficient reasons.",ANALYSIS

In the circumstances and bearing all the considerations of

the present case in mind it was impossible to hold that the

Sessions Judge did not impose a substantial sentence.

The Supreme Court set aside the sentence imposed by the

Court and restored that of the Sessions Judge as no adequate

reason bad been assigned by the High Court for considering

the sentence passed by the Sessions Judge as manifestly

inadequate.",PREAMBLE

 It is the case of the prosecution that on the first occasion the deceased was injected with 4 ml Tidijesic.",ANALYSIS

1440,4151,18367,18425,"According to her, Siva was her friend being a collegemate.",ANALYSIS
1441,4151,18426,18597,No other evidence has been led to prove that R (PW10) had any special relationship with accused Siva or that she had developed any special relationship with deceased Arun.,ANALYSIS
1442,4151,18598,18712,"The only evidence in this regard is the statement of R (PW10), which does not support the prosecution case at all.",ANALYSIS
1443,4151,18712,18918,"
 In this regard, it would also be pertinent to mention that in the first complaint filed by PW1, there is no mention of R (PW10), much less of her having any affair with either the accused or the deceased.",ANALYSIS
1444,4151,18919,19022,This was brought out for the first time only in the complaint filed four years after the death of Arun.,ANALYSIS
1445,4151,19023,19083,There is no explanation for this long silence of four years.,ANALYSIS

 4. CHANDRU WAS A MEDICAL STUDENT",ANALYSIS
1450,4151,19377,19592,Both the courts below have come to the conclusion that Chandru was asked by Siva to commit the crime because Chandru was a medical student and he alone knew how to inject the substance into the body of the deceased.,ANALYSIS
1451,4151,19593,19692,We are constrained to observe that the inference drawn by the courts below was totally ill founded.,ANALYSIS
1452,4151,19693,19775,Why would Chandru kill another human being just on the asking of the accused Siva?,ANALYSIS
1453,4151,19776,19875,"Chandru was a medical student, studying in a profession meant to save lives and not to kill people.",ANALYSIS
1454,4151,19876,20015,From the evidence on record it stands established that the deceased was a drug addict and had been taking injectible drugs for a long time.,ANALYSIS
1455,4151,20016,20085,It is well known that such drug addicts can easily inject themselves.,ANALYSIS
1456,4151,20086,20247,What has happened in this case is not clear but it cannot be said with certainty that Chandru had injected the poisonous substance into the body of the deceased.,ANALYSIS
1457,4151,20248,20284,There is no evidence in this regard.,ANALYSIS
1458,4151,20284,20462,"
As we have discussed above, it was not only Siva and Chandru who were coming to Chennai with deceased Arun but Siddharth and Mathesh were also coming to Chennai in the same car.",ANALYSIS
1459,4151,20463,20527,"However, they went back only after the car met with an accident.",ANALYSIS
1460,4151,20528,20728,All these boys were in their late teens or early 20s and two of them got scared after the accident and they went to the homes of their relatives and from there they contacted their respective mothers.,ANALYSIS
1461,4151,20729,20836,"Since they had obtained permission of their mothers by giving false excuses, they got scared and went back.",ANALYSIS
1462,4151,20837,20901,"Even as per the prosecution, Chandru had no motive to kill Arun.",ANALYSIS
1463,4151,20901,21108,"
Therefore, the inference drawn by the High Court as well as the trial court that Siva and Chandru had conspired or had the common intention of murdering Arun is not based on any cogent or reliable evidence.",ANALYSIS
1464,4151,21110,21338,"14. Other than the circumstances referred to above, there are other circumstances which go against the prosecution which we shall refer to now: 1. Inconsistency in the statement of PW1  PW1 is the maternal uncle of the deceased.",ANALYSIS
1465,4151,21339,21493,"In his first complaint made in the police station on 31.10.2004, there is no reference to R (PW10) or other facts which have been stated at a later stage.",ANALYSIS
1466,4151,21494,21627,The private complaint filed by him four years later is contrary to the first complaint filed by him immediately after the occurrence.,ANALYSIS
1467,4151,21628,21707,His explanation is that he was asked to sign on two blank papers by the police.,ANALYSIS
1468,4151,21708,21840,"First of all, we see no reason why the police in a case of this nature would try to help the accused and shield the actual criminal.",ANALYSIS
1469,4151,21841,22035,"Secondly, there is no material on record to show that PW1, the maternal uncle or PW 5, father of the deceased, ever complained to any authority that PW1 had been forced to sign two blank papers.",ANALYSIS
1470,4151,22036,22197,This is a case where the maternal uncle and the father of the deceased had approached the High Court on at least two occasions for transfer of the investigation.,ANALYSIS
1471,4151,22197,22252,"
They succeeded once and failed on the second occasion.",ANALYSIS
1472,4151,22252,22391,"
In case the version of PW1 that his signatures were taken on blank papers was correct, then he would have definitely said so much earlier.",ANALYSIS
1473,4151,22392,22517,He would have reported the matter to the higher authorities or made mention of this in the petitions filed in the High Court.,ANALYSIS
1474,4151,22518,22698,Despite a pointed query to the counsel for the original complainant and the informant and the State they failed to point out whether any such complaint had been made by PW1 or PW5.,ANALYSIS
1475,4151,22699,22806,"Therefore, we do not accept the version of PW1 that his signatures were obtained on blank sheets of papers.",ANALYSIS
1476,4151,22807,22871,This also casts a doubt on the veracity of the statement of PW1.,ANALYSIS
1477,4151,22873,22915,2. Delay in filing the private complaint  ,ANALYSIS
1478,4151,22915,23307,"It is true that PW1 and PW5 were moving the High Court for transfer of the case to some other investigating agency but, at the same time, it would be pertinent to mention that after the chargesheet was filed against Venki by the Investigating Officer (DW4), neither PW1 nor PW5 filed any protest petition to the effect that the accused (appellants herein) should also be arraigned as accused.",ANALYSIS
1479,4151,23308,23404,They let the matter go on and it was only after Venki died that the private complaint was filed.,ANALYSIS
1480,4151,23405,23576,There is no explanation why no protest petition was filed when the police had only made out a case against accused Venki and that too under Section 304 IPC and not murder.,ANALYSIS
1481,4151,23578,23639,3. PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the Court with clean hands  ,ANALYSIS
1482,4151,23639,23687,The motive has been introduced after four years.,ANALYSIS
1483,4151,23688,23837,The father and the maternal uncle of the deceased never brought up the issue of the deceased having conversations with R (PW10) at any earlier stage.,ANALYSIS
1484,4151,23837,23917,"
           Therefore, PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the court with clean hands.",ANALYSIS
1485,4151,23918,24027,They have cooked up the story of signing on blank papers and also cooked up the story relating to the motive.,ANALYSIS
1486,4151,24028,24133,"Therefore, their evidence is not reliable and a person cannot be convicted on the basis of such evidence.",ANALYSIS
1487,4151,24135,24267,15. All that is proved is that the deceased and the accused were sleeping in one room and the deceased died due to overdose of drug.,RATIO
1488,4151,24268,24350,The prosecution had miserably failed to prove that the accused injected this drug.,RATIO
1489,4151,24351,24457,"It is the case of the prosecution that the first injection was administered by Venki, which was only 4 ml.",RATIO
1490,4151,24458,24596,There is possibility of the deceased injecting himself on the second occasion sometime in the middle of the night or early in the morning.,RATIO
1491,4151,24597,24778,"In this context, we must remember that the doctor, who conducted the postmortem has not given any approximate time of death of the deceased which could have helped us in the matter.",RATIO
1492,4151,24779,24888,The circumstances proved cannot lead to the inference that it is the accused alone who committed the offence.,RATIO
1493,4151,24889,25064,"In fact, the prosecution has even failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death is homicidal in view of the inconsistencies in the medical evidence dealt by us above.",RATIO

Impressed overbearingly by the circumstance that the Sessions Court ""had the opportunity of observing the demeanour"" of the witnesses, the High Court apparenty thought that such an opportunity gave to the Sessions Court's judgment a mystical weight and authority, even though the learned Sessions Judge had not, in his judgment or while recording the evidence, made any special reference to the demeanour of the witnesses.",ANALYSIS
1553,4088,7820,8090,The High Court accepted the evidence of Ram Sanehi's children by observing that there was no material contradiction ill their evidence and that certain statements in the F.I.R. afforded a guarantee that the two witnesses were present when their father was done to death.,ANALYSIS
1554,4088,8091,8256,We will now proceed to show how several significant circumstances either escaped the attention of the High Court or were not given their due and rightful importance.,ANALYSIS
1555,4088,8258,8340,First as to the manner in which S.I. Sharma conducted investigation into the case.,ANALYSIS
1556,4088,8341,8564,"The offence took place at about 9 a.m. on June 9 and though the District Hospital at Farrukaabad was just 10 miles away, the dead body was not received at the hospital for nearly 24 hours after the incident had taken place.",ANALYSIS
1557,4088,8565,8830,The excuse offered by the prosecution that cartman was not willing to take the body at night is utterly flimsy because the Investigating officer could have easily made some alternate arrangement for despatchin the dead body for postmortem examination expeditiously.,ANALYSIS
1558,4088,8831,9070,"With the dead body lying at the scene of offence for nearly 12 hours and thereafter at the police station for another 8 or 9 hours, it was easy enough for the witnesses to mould their statements so as to accord with the nature of injuries.",ANALYSIS
1559,4088,9071,9298,The lnvestigating Officer did not make any note at all in the General Diary as to which witnesses were examined by him on the date of the occurrence which was obligatory upon him to do under paragraph 44 of the U.P. Police Act.,ANALYSIS
1560,4088,9298,9416,"
The time when the investigation was commenced and the time when it was concluded are not mentioned in the case diary.",ANALYSIS
1561,4088,9416,9566,"
The time when the Investigating officer reached the village and the time when he returned to the police station are also not noted in the case diary.",ANALYSIS
1562,4088,9567,9713,S.I. Sharma stated in his evidence that several important facts concerning the investigation were being stated by him in his evidence from memory.,ANALYSIS
1563,4088,9714,9826,"He reached the scene of offence at about 2-30 p.m.
but it was not until about 6 p.m. that he inspected the site.",ANALYSIS
1564,4088,9827,10167,The dead body was not removed from the scene of offence till about 9 p.m. and even that is open to grave doubt because the Investigating officer has admitted in his evidence that he was unable to say as to when the dead body was taken way from the spot and whether it was taken directly to the hospital or was detained somewhere on the way.,ANALYSIS
1565,4088,10168,10311,He was unable to say whether it was right or wrong that the dead body remained in the village till about 4 'O'clock on the morning of the 10th.,ANALYSIS
1566,4088,10312,10513,Forty or fifty persons had gathered at the scene of offence when the Investigating officer arrived but the record of the case does not show that the statement of any of those persons was ever recorded.,ANALYSIS
1567,4088,10514,10731,In fact even the statement of Kusuma Devi was recorded late at night for which the reason is stated to be that her elder sister Pushpa Devi died of shock on the evening of the 9th after hearing of her father's murder.,ANALYSIS
1568,4088,10732,10879,"It may be that Pushpa Devi died on the 9th, but apart from the cause of her death, the statement of Kusuma Devi need not have been held up so long.",ANALYSIS
1569,4088,10880,10974,We are doubtful if the Investigating officer at all knew on the 9th that Pushpa Devi had died.,ANALYSIS
1570,4088,10975,11058,He has admitted that his knowledge in that behalf was derived from hearsay reports.,ANALYSIS
1571,4088,11059,11270,"The appellant Subhash had surrendered before the Additional District Magistrate, Farrukhabad on the afternoon of the 9th itself while the other appellant Shyam Narain was arrested at Fatehgarh at about 2-40 p.m.",ANALYSIS
1572,4088,11271,11432,"The Investigating officer did not even know of these significant developments, though they had taken place just a few miles away from the scene of investigation.",ANALYSIS
1573,4088,11433,11533,He says that he learnt of the surrender and the arrest of the appellants on the evening of the 12th.,ANALYSIS
1574,4088,11533,11747,"
Mangali Prasad has been examined by the prosecution as an eye-witness and his name is mentioned in the F.I.R. as one of the four persons who arrived at the scene of offence even before the appellants had run away.",ANALYSIS
1575,4088,11748,11800,His statement was recorded 11 days later on June 20.,ANALYSIS
1576,4088,11801,11916,The F.I.R. mentions expressly that the appellants caught hold of the legs of the deceased and started dragging him.,ANALYSIS
1577,4088,11917,12142,The Investigating officer has not stated in the Panchnama of the scene of offence whether the ground was soft or hard or sandy which had great relevance on the allegation that the deceased was dragged over a certain distance.,ANALYSIS
1578,4088,12143,12338,"Finally, it is surprising that the Investigating officer did not think it worthwhile to pay a visit to the field where the deceased is alleged to have gone with his children for eating Kharbuzas.",ANALYSIS
1579,4088,12339,12469,"Indeed he stated that he was not in a position to say if there were Kharbuzas at all in the field, when the occurrence took place.",ANALYSIS
1580,4088,12469,12652,"
         The High Court has condoned these lapses on the part of the Investigating officer with the observation that he ""appears to have been inexperienced and somewhat negligent"".
 ",ANALYSIS
1581,4088,12652,12743,The Investigating officer has stated in his evidence that he had put in 7 years of service.,ANALYSIS
1582,4088,12744,12858,It is difficult to understand on what basis the High Court attributed the lapses on his part to mere inexperience.,ANALYSIS
1583,4088,12859,13103,"We will presently indicate the significance of the various lapses and loopholes in investigation but to say, as the High Court has done, that the Investigating Officer was ""somewhat negligent"" seems to us in the circumstances a grave euphemism.",ANALYSIS
1584,4088,13103,13235,"
 We will now proceed to deal with the various circumstances which, in our opinion, render it unsafe to accept the prosecution case.",ANALYSIS
1585,4088,13235,13362,"
 Dr. S.C. Pandiya who performed the post-mortem examination has described in his evidence the injuries received by Ram Sanehi.",ANALYSIS
1586,4088,13363,13500,"In all he found 7 injuries on the dead body, out of which injuries 1, 3 and 7, injuries 2 and 4, and injuries 5 and 6 are interconnected.",ANALYSIS
1587,4088,13501,13582,"Injury No. 1 is described as a ""shot wound"" with its entry above the left nipple.",ANALYSIS
1588,4088,13583,13669,Injury No. 3 is described as multiple rounded abrasions on the left side of the chest.,ANALYSIS
1589,4088,13670,13764,"Injury No. 7 is the wound of exit on the right scapular region, corresponding to injury No. 1.",ANALYSIS
1590,4088,13765,13920,rnjury No. 2 consists of 8 gunshot wounds of entry below the right nipple while injury No. 4 consists of multiple rounded abrasions above the right nipple.,ANALYSIS
1591,4088,13921,14091,Injury No. 5 is a gun-shot wound of entry on the back of the left forearm while injury No. 6 is the corresponding wound of exit near the ulnar aspect of the left forearm.,ANALYSIS
1592,4088,14091,14288,"
 The evidence of Dr. Pandiya and the description of the injuries given by him in the post-mortem report tend to show that two different kinds of firearms were used by the assailants of Ram Sanehi.",ANALYSIS
1593,4088,14289,14440,Injury No. 1 was caused by a bullet and that is clear not only from the description of the injury but from what Dr. Pandiya has stated in his evidence.,ANALYSIS
1594,4088,14441,14554,"He says: ""The bullet, which had entered through injury No. 1 went out straight after emerging from injury No. 7"".",ANALYSIS
1595,4088,14555,14600,Injuries Nos. 2 and 5 were caused by pellets.,ANALYSIS
1596,4088,14601,14736,"This shows that whereas injury No. 1 was caused by a firearm in the nature of a rifle, injuries 2 and 5 were caused by an ordinary gun.",ANALYSIS
1597,4088,14737,14946,"The medical evidence thus falsifies the eye- witnesses' account according to which, the appellant Subhash alone was armed with a double-barrelled gun, the other appellant Shyam Narain being armed with a lathi.",ANALYSIS
1598,4088,14947,15161,"The objective inference arising from the nature of injuries received by the deceased has a significant impact on the case of the prosecution, which has been overlooked by both the Sessions Court and the High Court.",ANALYSIS
1599,4088,15161,15404,"
 While we are on the medical evidence it would be appropriate to mention that there was no tatooing or charring on any of the firearm injuries which, according to the doctor, shows that the firing was done from a distance of more than 4 feet.",ANALYSIS
1600,4088,15405,15783,"In the First Information Report Bal Kishore has stated that as soon as he, his father and sister, reached the culvert, Subhash ""touching the chest"" of Ram Sanehi ""with thebarrel of his gun"" said that he shall not leave him alive; Shyam Narain thereupon exhorted Subhash not to delay and fire immediately; Subhash then fired three shots in quick succession, one of which mishred.",ANALYSIS
1601,4088,15784,15983,"The trend of the F.I.R. is that Subhash fired the first two shots at Ram Sanehi from a point blank range, in which event indisputably, there would have been tatooing and charring around the injuries.",ANALYSIS
1602,4088,15984,16161,"Bal Kishore has attempted to offer an explanation that what he meant to say in his compaint was that Subhash trained his gun ""towards"" Ram Sanehi's chest and not ""on"" his chest.",ANALYSIS
1603,4088,16161,16244,"
This explanation is an after thought and in the circumstances difficult to accept.",ANALYSIS
1604,4088,16245,16340,"Thus in another important respect, the medical evidence falsifies the case of the prose cution.",ANALYSIS
1605,4088,16340,16482,"
 There is another aspect of the medical evidence which, though, not as important as the two aspects mentioned above, may also be referred to.",ANALYSIS
1606,4088,16483,16610,The case of the prosecution is that Ram Sanehi had gone to his Kharbuza field with his son and daughter for eating Kharobuzsas.,ANALYSIS
1607,4088,16610,16718,There is evidence that they did eat Kharbuzas and almost immediately there after they started back for home.,ANALYSIS
1608,4088,16719,16793,"Within less than 5 minutes, Ram Sanehi met with his deat near the culvert.",ANALYSIS
1609,4088,16794,16963,The post-mortem report shows that Ram Sanehi's stomach was empty which means that the evidence that he had eaten Kharbuzas just a little time before his death is untrue.,ANALYSIS
1610,4088,16964,17082,Bal Kishore tried to wriggle out of this situation by saying that Ram Sanehi had eaten just a small slice of Kharbuza.,ANALYSIS
1611,4088,17083,17285,"But even there, Dr.
Pandiya has stated that if the entire slice of Kharbuza was eaten by Ram Sanehi, its remains would be found in the stomach provided there was no vomiting after the gun-shot injuries.",ANALYSIS
1612,4088,17286,17417,"Since Ram Sanehi had not vomited, his large intestines could not have been found to be empty if the story of his children was true.",ANALYSIS
1613,4088,17417,17694,"
 This last circumstance may at first sight seem trivial but its importance consists in the fact that the visit of Ram Sanehi, along with his children, to the Kharbuza field for the purpose of eating Kharbuzas is the very genesis of the incident which happened on June 9, 1972.",ANALYSIS
1614,4088,17695,17981,"Coupled with the circumstance that the Investigating officer did not even pay a visit to the Kharbuza field, leave alone making a Panchnama thereof, the conclusion is irresistible that the story that the children had accompanied their father to the Kharbuza field lacks a factual basis.",ANALYSIS
1615,4088,17983,18238,The other circumstances which render the prosecution case suspect are these (1) Ram Sanehi is alleged to have been drageed over 6 or 7 paces by the appellants but not even an abrasion was found on his back or stomach which could be attributed to dragging.,ANALYSIS
1616,4088,18239,18492,(2) Thirty or forty persons are alleged to have collected at the sence of occurrence but Bal Kishore was not able to mention the name of even one of them and it is common ground that the Investigating officer did not record the statement of any of them.,ANALYSIS
1617,4088,18493,18694,"(3) Jhabboo Singh, Shyam Lal Brij Bhushan and Mangali Prasad reached the scene of offence even before the appellants had fled away but none from amongst the first three was examined by the prosecution.",ANALYSIS
1618,4088,18695,18823,Mangali Prasad was examined as an eye-witness but he has been concurrently disbelieved by the Sessions Court and the High Court.,ANALYSIS
1619,4088,18824,19179,"(4) Though the motive of the offence is alleged to be that in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal against the appellant Subhash, the deceased Ram Sanehi was cited as a witness, Mangali Prasad's evidence shows that immediately after the firing, Bal Kishore told him that Ram Sanehi was murdered because of the disputes concerning the election to the Pradhanki.",ANALYSIS
1620,4088,19180,19364,"What Bal Kishore told Mangali Prasad immediately after the incident seems more probable because, one Virendrapal had contested that election and the appellant Subhash had defeated him.",ANALYSIS
1621,4088,19365,19596,"When Bal Kishore went to lodge his F.I.R. at the police station he was accompanied by Virendrapal, though an attempt was made to show that Virendrapal was only standing outside the police station and had met-Bal Kishore accidently.",ANALYSIS
1622,4088,19597,19753,(5) The story of Bal Kishore that after the appellant Subhash fired 2 shots he re-loaded his gun but the re-loaded cartridge misured makes hardly any sense.,ANALYSIS
1623,4088,19754,19947,"Subhash was armed with a double barrelled gun and having fired 2 fatal shots from a close range at his target, it is unlikely that he would re-load the gun and that too with only one cartridge.",ANALYSIS
1624,4088,19948,20078,"And if that cartridge misfired, it is impossible to understand how it could be found concealed in the folds of Ram Sanehi's dhoti.",ANALYSIS
1625,4088,20078,20248,"
 There is only one other aspect of the matter which remains to be considered and since the High Court has placed great reliance thereon, it is necessary to deal with it.",ANALYSIS
1626,4088,20249,20526,"The F.I.R. which lodged at about 12 O'clock at noon on the 9th itself mentions that after Ram Sanehi was murdered, the appellant Subhash told his companion Shyam Narain that he himself was going to surrender before a court and that Shyam Narain should make his own arrangement.",ANALYSIS
1627,4088,20527,20650,"In fact, Subhash did surrender in the court of the Additional District Magistrate, Farrukhabad, at about 4 p.m. on the 9th.",ANALYSIS
1628,4088,20651,20868,What the High Court has over-looked is that Subhash did not surrender in connection with the murder of Ram Sanehi but he surrendered along with the 13 or 14 other accused against whom Pooran Lal had filed a complaint.,ANALYSIS
1629,4088,20869,20991,"In so far as Shyam Narain is concerned, the High Court is wrong in saying that he managed somehow to get himself arrested.",ANALYSIS
1630,4088,20992,21219,"The evidence of Constable Virendra Singh shows that Shyam Narain was arrested because he was crossing the railway lines and if he was not caught, he would have been run over by the two trains coming from Kanpur and Farrukhabad.",ANALYSIS
1631,4088,21220,21316,"This was hardly any sensible way of making an ""arrangement"" for himself, as directed by Subhash.",ANALYSIS
1632,4088,21317,21499,It is therefore not as if the statement attributed to Subhash in the F.I.R. is corroborated by subsequent events so as to afford a guarantee to Bal Kishore's presence at the culvert.,ANALYSIS
1633,4088,21499,21778,"
 We are conscious that the Sessions Court and the High Court have both held that the appellants committed the murder of Ram Sanehi but the weight of the circumstances which we have discussed above is so preponderating that even the concurrent finding cannot be allowed to stand.",RATIO
1634,4088,21779,21899,"In any event, it seems to us impossible to hold that the prosecution has established its case beyond a reasonable doubt.",RATIO
1635,4088,21899,22144,"
 We therefore allow this appeal, set aside the order of conviction and sentence recorded by the High Court and the Sessions Court and direct that the appellants shall be set at liberty.

1921,4244,10482,10657,The plea that there were other Directorsof the company besides the appellants who had dominion over the cloth has been negatived by the High Court and in our judgment rightly.,ANALYSIS
1922,4244,10658,11020,"Direct evidence to establish misappropriation of the cloth over which the appellants had dominion is undoubtedly lacking, but to establish a charge of criminal breach of trust, the prosecution is not obliged to prove the precise mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which he has dominion.",ANALYSIS
1923,4244,11021,11394,"The principal ingredient of the offence being dishonest misappropriation or conversion which may not ordinarily be a matter of direct proof, entrustment of property and failure in breach of an obligation to account for the property entrusted, if proved, may in the light of other circumstances, justifiably lead to -an inference of dishonest misappropriation or conversion.",ANALYSIS

Conviction of a person for the offence of criminal breach of trust may not, in all cases, be founded merely on his failure to account for the property entrusted to him, or over which he has dominion, even when a duty to account is imposed upon him, but where he is unable to account or renders an explanation for his failure to account which is untrue, an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent may readily be made.",ANALYSIS

In this court, counsel for the first appellant contended that failure to return the cloth may give rise to a civil liability to make good the loss occasionedthereby, but in the circumstances of the case, the first appellant cannot be found guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust.",ANALYSIS
1931,4244,12829,13303,"Counsel submitted that the first appellant had left Bombay in 1950 and had settled down in Ahmedabad and was attending to a factory in that town, that thereafter the first appellant was involved in insolvency proceedings and was unable to attend to the affairs of the company in Bombay, and if, on account of the pre-occupation of the first appellant at Ahmedabad, he was unable to visit Bombay and the goods were lost, no criminal misappropriation can be attributed to him.",ANALYSIS

2109,4242,12969,13092,"Therefore, it was permissible for the legislature to deny them the exemption extended to the other members of their tribes.",ARG_PETITIONER
2110,4242,13092,13138,"
 This contention appears to be without merit.",ANALYSIS
2111,4242,13139,13254,It may be that for the purpose of taxation a classification can be made on the basis of administrative convenience.,ANALYSIS
2112,4242,13255,13427,But we fail to see how the case of the government servants stands on a footing different from that of the employees in statutory corporations or even well recognised firms.,ANALYSIS
2113,4242,13428,13550,"That apart, administrative convenience which can afford  just basis for classification must be a real and substantial one.",ANALYSIS
2114,4242,13551,13593,We see no such administrative convenience.,ANALYSIS
2115,4242,13594,13736,"The learned Solicitor-General, next contended that 'the classification can be justified on the basis of past legislative practice and history.",ARG_PETITIONER
2116,4242,13737,14135,"In this connection he invited our attention to the fact that before this country got independence, the income of the persons in the service of the government 'but serving outside British India such as in Baluchistan, or native States was subject to tax under the Indian Income Tax laws though other persons residing in those places were not subject to the income tax laws in force in British India.",ARG_PETITIONER
2117,4242,14135,14406,"
 The L10 Sup C1/67-12 reason for the same is that the Indian legislature had no.
 legislative competence to tax the residents of those areas, but it had competence to tax the income of the persons in government service though they might be serving outside British India.",ARG_PETITIONER
2118,4242,14406,14687,"
 The learned Solicitor-General next invited our attention to a notification issued by the Government of India as long back as 6-6-1890, under which the income earned by members of certain scheduled tribes other than those serving under the government was exempted from income tax.",ARG_PETITIONER
2119,4242,14688,14921,"He also invited our attention to Finance department Notification No.
 788F dated 21-3-1922 under which the income of indigenous hill men other than persons in the service of government, residing in certain areas were exempt from tax.",ARG_PETITIONER
2120,4242,14922,15183,"On the basis of those notifications, he wanted us to spell out a well recognised legislative practice and history under which the government servants as a class were excluded from the benefit of income tax exemption extended to other persons similarly situated.",ARG_PETITIONER
2121,4242,15184,15325,"In this connection, he placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Narottam Kishore Dev Varma and Ors. v. Union of India and another(1).",ARG_PETITIONER
2122,4242,15326,15650,Therein this Court was called upon to consider the validity of s. 87B of the Code of Civil Procedure which prescribed that a Ruler of a former Indian State cannot be sued in any court otherwise competent to try the suit except with the consent of the Central Government certified in writing by a Secretary to the Government.,ARG_PETITIONER
2123,4242,15651,15721,The validity of that provision was challenged on the basis of Art. 14.,ARG_PETITIONER
2124,4242,15722,16037,"This Court upheld the. validity of that provision having regard to the legislative and historical background of that provision, but at the same time observed that considered in the light of basic principles of equality before law, it would be odd to allow the section to continue prospectively for all time to come.",ARG_PETITIONER
2125,4242,16038,16274,"After setting out the legislative background of that provision, this Court observed: ""The legislative background to which we have referred cannot be divorced from the historical background which is to be found for instance, in Art. 362.",ARG_PETITIONER
2126,4242,16275,16696,"This Article provides that in the exercise of the power of Parliament or of any legislature of any State to make laws or in the exercise of the executive power of the Union or of a State, due regard shall be had to the guarantee or assurance given under any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause (1) of Art. 291 with respect to the personal rights, privileges and dignities of a Ruler of an Indian State.",ARG_PETITIONER

2129,4242,17085,17228,One of the privileges is that of extra territoriality and exemption from civil jurisdiction except with the sanction of the Central Government.,ARG_PETITIONER
2130,4242,17229,17609,"It was thought that the privilege which was claimed by foreign Rulers and Rulers of Indian States prior to the independence of the country should be continued even after independence was attained and the States had become part of India, and that is how in 1951, the Civil Procedure Code was amended and present sections 86, 87, 87A and 87B came to be enacted in the present form.""",ARG_PETITIONER

2141,4242,18669,18914,Sri Setalvad learned counsel for the respondent is justified in his comment that classification based on past legislative practice and history does not mean that because in the past the legislature was enacting arbitrary laws it could do so now.,ANALYSIS
2142,4242,18914,19237,"
 It was the contention of the learned Solicitor-General that exemption from income tax was given to members of certain scheduled tribes due to their economic and social backwardness; it is not possible to consider a government servant as socially and economically backward and hence the exemption was justly denied to him.",ARG_PETITIONER
2143,4242,19238,19471,"According to the Solicitor-General, once a tribal becomes a government servant he is lifted out of his social environment and assimilated into the forward sections of the society and therefore he needs no. more any crutch to lean on.",ARG_PETITIONER

2145,4242,19525,19645,The exemption in question was not given to individuals either on the basis of their social status or economic resources.,ANALYSIS

2154,4242,20417,21053,"
 It was lastly contended by the learned Solicitor-General a contention which was not taken either in the return or before the High Court or in the appeal memo.- that it is not possible to strike down only a portion of s.
4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act. 1922 and s. 10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, namely, the words ""provided that such member is not in the service of government"" found in s. 4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and the words ""who. is not in, the1 service of government"" in s.

 ""(i) Whether the prosecution has proved beyond all reasonable doubt by adducing cogent and reliable evidence stating that on 10-3-2007 at about 8.30 a.m. in the land Sy.No.91 of Koralli the accused in furtherance of their common intention wrongfully restrained C.W.2- Sharanappa to proceed in the direction in which he has right to proceed, the accused caused grievous injuries to C.W.2-Sharanappa by assaulting him from Talwar and knife and have attempted to commit the murder of C.W.2- Sharanappa by assaulting him with Talwar and axe and accused No.3 abetted accused No.1 and 2 in the commission of the said offence and thereby the accused have committed the offence punishable under Sections 341, 326, 307 and 109 R/w. Section 34 of Indian Penal Code?
 (ii) What order?""",ISSUE
2230,4216,3992,4159,"
 4. The background to the alleged offence committed by the accused was that the complainant's father had three brothers namely, Gurushantappa, Ranojappa and Kupendra.",FAC
2231,4216,4160,4275,"Kupendra was said to be no more and the family owned lands bearing Survey Number 91, 94, and 95 of Koralli village.",FAC
2232,4216,4276,4344,Gurushantappa had divided the land between himself and his brothers.,FAC
2233,4216,4344,5105,"
 Gurushantappa's sons namely Ratanchand and Mallikarjun were quarreling amongst themselves in connection with land bearing Survey No.91 to the effect that the complainant did not have any share in the land and had called upon him not to cultivate the land and they had also instituted proceedings before the office of the Deputy Commissioner as regards their claim in respect of the land.
But however, the complainant was said to be cultivating the land throughout and therefore he negated the objection raised by the sons of Gurushantappa and had grown sugar cane in the said land and the brother of the complaint namely Sharanappa had obtained permission to supply sugar cane to the Bhusnoor sugar factory and had arranged for harvesting the sugar cane crop.",FAC
2234,4216,5106,5468,"On 09.03.2007 labourers had been engaged to harvest the sugar cane crop and when the operations were on, at about 8.30 a.m. on 10.03.2007 the complainant had visited the land and at that point he saw his brother Sharanappa and his son Hanumantharaya were at the land and Ratanchand and Mallikarjun were armed with an axe and a knife and they were all quarreling.",FAC
2235,4216,5469,5651,"Mallikarjun and Ratanchand were questioning Sharanappa and his nephew Hanumantharaya, as to what right they had to harvest the sugar cane and thereafter had proceeded to attack them.",FAC
2236,4216,5652,6012,"Ratanchand had assaulted Sharanappa with the sword on his right palm, as a result of which his thumb was said to have been severed from his hand and when the complainant and Hanumantharaya tried to intervene, the accused, it is alleged had pushed them to the ground and continued to assault Sharanappa on his left shoulder and thereby caused grievous injuries.",FAC
2237,4216,6013,6166,"The accused Ratanchand once again is said to have assaulted Sharanappa on the left side of his hand and neck, as a result of which he fell to the ground.",FAC
2238,4216,6167,6266,"Thereafter, the accused are said to have left the place on the assumption that Sharanappa was dead.",FAC
2239,4216,6267,6373,"There was a jeep standing by, belonging to one Babu Kalashetty on which the accused are said to have fled.",FAC
2240,4216,6374,6511,"It is further alleged that accused No.3 who was also present on the land, exhorted accused Nos.1 and 2 to attack Sharanappa and kill him.",FAC
2241,4216,6512,6699,In the meanwhile the complainant and Hanumantharaya had brought a private jeep and thereafter they had carried Sharanappa to a Government Hospital at Aland and admitted him for treatment.,FAC
2242,4216,6700,6867,"It is thereafter that the Police Sub-Inspector, Aland has visited the hospital at about 10.00 a.m. and recorded the statement of the complainant and registered a case.",FAC
2243,4216,6868,7064,"After further investigation and after gathering other material objects, recording statements of other witnesses and after completion of proceedings, the matter was committed to the Sessions Court.",FAC
2244,4216,7064,7315,"
 5. It is in this background that the Court below after having found that though it could not be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, the evidence in support of the alleged charges against the accused was the evidence of PWs-1, 4, 5 and 9.",ANALYSIS
2245,4216,7316,7664,It was found that PW-1 categorically denied the presence of accused No.3 and consequently he had stated in his evidence that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe and accused No.2 assaulted him with a sword but contrary to this PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that accused No.1 assaulted Sharanappa with an axe and accused No.2 assaulted him with a sword.,ANALYSIS
2246,4216,7665,7964,"Further, PW-1 in his evidence had stated that he was alone on the land but contrary to this PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that they were also present on the land at the time of the incident and that when they tried to intervene, to rescue Sharanappa, the accused No.1 threatened them and pushed them away.",ANALYSIS
2247,4216,7965,8143,"Therefore, the Court below has seriously doubted the very presence of PW-4 and PW-5 in view of the contradictory statements and coming from the mouth of PW-1 the injured witness.",ANALYSIS
2248,4216,8144,8414,"The Court below has also contemplated that if really PWs-4 and 5 were also present on the land and tried to rescue Sharanappa from the accused who were armed with a sword and an axe as alleged, it is difficult to understand as to how they had not sustained any injuries.",ANALYSIS
2249,4216,8416,8700,6. Further it was also in the evidence of PWs-4 and 5 that they carried Sharanappa to hospital in a jeep and that he was heavily bleeding and their clothes were also blood stained but interestingly the Investigating Officer had not thought it fit to seize those blood stained clothes.,ANALYSIS
2250,4216,8701,8837,"Further, PW-1 in his evidence has stated that at the time of incident there were 20 labourers engaged in harvesting the sugar cane crop.",ANALYSIS
2251,4216,8838,9052,"However, the Investigating Officer had not made any attempt to record the statement of those witnesses who were the best witnesses to speak about the incident, as they would have been totally independent witnesses.",ANALYSIS
2252,4216,9053,9240,"That if really such an offence had been committed, as alleged in the complaint and as stated by PWs-4 and 5, the labourers who were working in the field would have witnessed the incident.",ANALYSIS
2253,4216,9241,9660,"Therefore, in the absence of any such independent evidence on record, the testimony of the said witnesses has been characterized as being tutored and interested testimony, especially, when there are material contradictions as regards the weapons seized and the manner in which the same have stated to have been employed by the accused in assaulting the injured and which is contradictorily stated by the said witnesses.",ANALYSIS
2254,4216,9662,9817,"7. Further, PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that immediately after the incident they carried Sharanappa first to the police station and thereafter to the hospital.",ANALYSIS
2255,4216,9818,9991,But the evidence of the Investigating Officer discloses that after he was informed of the incident he had come to the hospital and recorded the statement of the complainant.,ANALYSIS
2256,4216,9991,10123,"
This is yet another contradiction which has been disbelieved by the Court as to the manner in which the incident may have occurred.",ANALYSIS
2257,4216,10123,10314,"
Apart from these witnesses, there were other witnesses such as PW- 9 who was a circumstantial witness of the incident and the evidence of that witness was also of no help to the prosecution.",ANALYSIS
2258,4216,10316,10705,"8. Similarly, PW-6 who was the father of PW-1 had deposed that he was in his house at the time of the incident and when he visited the land, PW-1 had already been carried to the hospital for treatment and in this manner the Court below has discarded the evidence of this witness, apart from PWs-10, 12 and 14 who were all formal witnesses in respect of the panchanama and spot mahazar etc.",ANALYSIS
2259,4216,10706,10860,"In fact PWs-12 and 14 who are the panch witnesses and seizure mahazar, have not supported the prosecution case and they were treated as hostile witnesses.",ANALYSIS
2260,4216,10862,11307,"9. Further, the Court below has discussed the evidence of PW- 3, the Medical practitioner of the Government Hospital, Aland, who had stated that Sharanappa was brought by one Nagappa for treatment and that he had been assaulted with an axe and a knife and the doctor has spoken about the serious injuries which were identified as seven in number and that the patient was shifted to a larger hospital as the injuries were very grievous in nature.",ANALYSIS
2261,4216,11308,11508,"Though the medical evidence clearly indicated that the victim had suffered grievous injuries, the evidence of the other witnesses was not consistent in the manner as to how those injuries were caused.",ANALYSIS
2262,4216,11510,11607,10. PW-1 deposed that there was a property dispute between his father and father of accused No.1.,ANALYSIS
2263,4216,11608,11952,"He has narrated that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm, as a result of which the thumb got severed and accused No.2 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm and also on the wrist of his left hand and accused No.1 repeated his assault with the axe on the left portion of his chest, thereafter he had lost consciousness.",ANALYSIS
2264,4216,11953,12140,"He had further stated that when accused Nos.1 and 2 had attacked him, there was none present on the land and that at the time of the incident accused No.3 was carrying water to her house.",ANALYSIS
2265,4216,12141,12227,"However, in his cross- examination he had denied that accused No.3 was present at all.",ANALYSIS
2266,4216,12227,12331,"
On which he was treated as a hostile witness and the prosecution has cross-examined him on that aspect.",ANALYSIS
2267,4216,12331,12664,"
 11. PW-5 who is the son of PW-1 had stated that accused No.1 had assaulted PW-1 on his right palm with the sword as a result of which the thumb was severed and he and PW-4 intervened.
Accused No.2 had threatened him with the axe thereafter accused No.2 continued to assault his father with an axe on the left hand causing injuries.",ANALYSIS
2268,4216,12665,12759,Accused No.2 also caused injury on the left shoulder and thereafter he had lost consciousness.,ANALYSIS
2269,4216,12760,12843,That accused No.3 was all along exhorting accused Nos.1 and 2 to murder Sharanappa.,ANALYSIS
2270,4216,12843,13388,"
 12. Given these inconsistencies in the case of the prosecution, though it cannot be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, since the manner in which the incident had unfolded and the participation of the accused, as alleged, being inconsistently narrated by the witnesses, the trial Court has rightly felt that it was not possible to reconcile the inconsistencies and contradictions and therefore has held that prosecution has failed to bring home the charges beyond all reasonable doubt as against the accused and has acquitted them.",ANALYSIS
2271,4216,13389,13659,"Though the learned Additional Advocate General would make an effort to salvage the case, as could be seen from the evidence tendered, it is full of inconsistencies which cannot be reconciled and the trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused on the grounds as stated.",RATIO

On analysis of the evidence on record P.W. 2 the SI of Excise deposed that on 13.05.2015, while he was performing patrolling duty at Kuturma area, found that the accused was coming on the road by holding one plastic jerry cane in his hand, so on suspicion, he detained the accused Gauranga Kishan and on search recovered seven litres of ID liquor containing in the plastic jerry cane from the possession of the accused.",ANALYSIS

2472,4178,12425,13234,"
 This will be apparent from a bare reading of s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, which provides : ""Whoever has in his possession or conveys in any manner, or offers for sale or pawn, anything which there is         reason to believe is stolen property or property fraudulently obtained shall, if he fails to account for such possession or to act to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term (which may extend to one year but shall not, except for reasons to be recorded in writing, be less taken one month and shall also be liable to the fine which may extend to five hundred rupees).
         Even in respect of that offence, the police did not register any case or enter any F.I.R. which normally furnishes a foundation for commencing a police investigation.",STA
2473,4178,13235,13323,The police did not open the packages or prepare inventories of the goods packed therein.,ANALYSIS
2474,4178,13324,13386,"Indeed, the police appear to have dropped further proceedings.",ANALYSIS
2475,4178,13387,13499,"They did not take any steps for prosecuting the appellant even for an offence under the Bombay Police Act, 1951.",ANALYSIS
2476,4178,13500,13652,"They informed the customs authorities, who opened the packages, inspected the goods and on finding them contraband goods, seized them under a Panchnama.",ANALYSIS
2477,4178,13653,13926,"The Customs authorities called the appellant and his companion to the Customs House, took them into custody, and after due compliance with the requirements of law, the Inspector of Customs questioned the appellant and recorded his statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act.",ANALYSIS
2478,4178,13926,14102,"
Under the circumstances it was manifest that at the time when the Custom officer recorded the statement of the appellant, the latter was not formally ""accused of any offence.""",ANALYSIS
2479,4178,14103,14254,The High Court was therefore right in holding that the statement recorded by the Inspector of Customs was not hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution.,ANALYSIS
2480,4178,14264,14363,"The next question to be considered is, whether this statement was hit by s. 24 of the Evidence Act.",ISSUE
2481,4178,14364,14526,The contention is that this statement was obtained under compulsion of law inasmuch as he was required to state the truth under threat of prosecution for perjury.,ANALYSIS
2482,4178,14526,14602,"
         For reasons that follow, we are unable to sustain this contention.",ANALYSIS
2483,4178,14602,15405,"
         To attract the prohibition enacted in s. 24, Evidence Act, these facts must be established: (i) that the statement in question is a confession; (ii) that such confession has been made by an accused person; (iii)that it has been made to a person in authority; (iv) that the confession has been obtained by reason of any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority; (v) such inducement, threat or promise, must have reference to the charge against the accused person; (vi) the inducement, threat or promise must in the opinion of the Court be sufficient to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.",ANALYSIS
2484,4178,15405,15487,"
         In the present case, facts (i), (iv) and (vi) have not been established.",ANALYSIS
2485,4178,15488,15579,"Firstly, the statement in question is not a ""confession' within the contemplation of s. 24.",ANALYSIS
2486,4178,15580,15769,"It is now well-settled that a statement in order to amount to a ""confession"" must either admit in terms the offence, or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence.",ANALYSIS
2487,4178,15770,15856,"An admission of an incriminating fact, howsoever grave, is not by itself a confession.",ANALYSIS
2488,4178,15857,16097,"A statement which contains an exculpatory assertion of some fact, which if true, would negative the offence alleged, cannot amount to a confession (see Pakala Narayana v. R.; Plavinder Kaur v.
State of Punjab; Om Prakash v. State.
         ",PRE_RELIED
2489,4178,16097,16232,A perusal of the statement Ex. I made by the appellant before the Inspector of Customs would show that it contained exculpatory matter.,ANALYSIS
2490,4178,16233,16423,"Therein, the deponent claimed that he was not aware that the packages which were loaded in the truck were contraband goods, and alleged that the goods were not loaded under his instructions.",ANALYSIS
2491,4178,16424,16576,"The deponent claimed to be an innocent traveller in the truck when he said: ""I did not ask Mullaji (driver) what goods were being loaded in his lorry...",ANALYSIS

2493,4178,16660,16833,"
         Moreover, the incriminating facts admitted in this statement, do not, even if taken cumulatively amount to admission of all the facts which constitute any offence.",ANALYSIS
2494,4178,16834,17008,"To bring home an offence under s. 135 of the Customs Act, in addition to the facts admitted in Ex. I, it had to be established further that these goods were contraband goods.",ANALYSIS
2495,4178,17008,17158,"
         For these reasons, it could be said beyond doubt, that the statement Ex. 1 was not a ""confession"" within the meaning of s. 24, Evidence Act.",ANALYSIS
2496,4178,17158,17332,"
         Secondly, it has not been shown that the Customs officer-though a person in authority-had offered any inducement or held out any threat or promise to the appellant.",ANALYSIS
2497,4178,17332,17537,"
         Christopher Soares, the Inspector of (Customs (P. W. 4) testified that no threats, coercion or inducements were used and that the statement Ex. 1 was made by the appellant, voluntarily.
         ",FAC
2498,4178,17537,17874,"While it may be conceded that a person summoned by an officer of Customs to make a statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act, is under compulsion of law to state the truth, the compulsion there under, assuming it amounts to a threat, does not proceed ""from a person in authority"" within the contemplation of s. 24, but emanates from law.",ANALYSIS
2499,4178,17874,18393,"
         Thirdly, the mere fact that the Inspector of Customs had, before recording the statement, warned the deponent of the possibility of hisprosecution for perjury in case he did not make the statement truthfully, cannot be construed as a threat held out by the officer which could have reasonably caused the person making the statement to suppose that he would by making that statement, gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him for smuggling.
         ",ANALYSIS
2500,4178,18393,18530,"In view of what has been said above, we have no hesitation in holding that the statement Ex. 1, was not barred under s. 24, Evidence Act.",ANALYSIS
2501,4178,18531,18641,"The statement Ex. P-1 was clearly admissible under s. 21, Evidence Act as an admission of incriminating facts.",ANALYSIS
2502,4178,18641,19155,"
         Lastly, Mr. Chaudhry tried to contend that the incriminating facts admitted in Ex. 1 taken along with the other facts appearing in the evidence of prosecution witnesses, were insufficient to establish an offence under s. 135, Customs Act against the appellant because no notification under sub-s. (2) of s. 123, of the Customs Act had been issued in respect of the import of the goods of the kind seized, and the aid of the statutory presumption under that section was not available to the prosecution.

2503,4178,19155,19195,We are unable to accept this contention.,ANALYSIS
2504,4178,19196,19518,"While it is true that in the absence of the requisite notification, the statutory presumption under s. 123 could not be invoked by the prosecution, the circumstances established unerringly raise an inference with regard to all the factual ingredients of an offence under s. 135(b) read with s.
 135(ii) of the Customs Act.",ANALYSIS

HEADNOTE:
The Dravida Kazhagam sponsored and organised a conference.",PREAMBLE

But the conference was a separate body with its own
organisation and office where correspondence relating to it
was received and dealt with, and it had its own Secretaries.",PREAMBLE

of one of the resolutions was put in shape by the respondent
Who was a member of the Dravida Kazhagam.",PREAMBLE

moved by the president of the conference and passed by the
conference.",PREAMBLE
2523,4243,956,1075,"The appellants were either editors or publishers
of newspapers in which a news item was published about the
conference.",PREAMBLE
2524,4243,1076,1222,"The news item however did not mention either
the Dravida Kazhagam or the respondent or any sponsor of the
resolution eithter by name or otherwise.",PREAMBLE
2525,4243,1223,1476,"The respondent
wrote letter to the appellants, signing and describing
himself' as Chairman of the Reception Committee of the
conference, containing that the news item had distorted the
resolution and asked them to publish a correction and
clarification.",PREAMBLE
2526,4243,1477,1678,"A few days later, a lawyers notice was sent
to the appellants in which the respondent complained that
the news item was defamatory and had tarnished the image of
the conference and demanded an apology.",PREAMBLE
2527,4243,1679,1812,"Thereafter, the
respondent filed a complaint under Ss. 500 and 501, I.P.C.
against the appellants as they did not tender any apology.",PREAMBLE

on the basis of the complaint and the evidence he recorded,
the Magistrate issued process.",PREAMBLE
2529,4243,1904,1996,"The appellants moved the
High Court under s. 561 A, Cr-. P.C., for quashing the
proceedings.",PREAMBLE
2530,4243,1997,2485,"They contended that the respondent was not ,in
aggrieved part\, within the meaning of s. 198, Cr.P.
C., that he had filed the complaint in his capacity as
Chairman of the Reception Committee of the conference and
not in his individual capacity, that in the absence of any
reference to him in the news item he had no cause for a
complaint, and that the conference, 'being an undefined and
an amorphous body, the respondent, is a member or part of

such body, could not lodge the complaint.",PREAMBLE
2531,4243,2486,2812,"The High Court,

however, held that the respondent was a member of the

Dravida Kazhagam which was an identifiable group, and was

therefore a person aggrieved within the meaning of s. 198,

proceedings taken by     the Magistrate,

HELD: (1) Under s. 198, Cr.P.C.",PREAMBLE

cognizance of an offence falling inter alia under Chap.

XXI, I.P.C., that is, ss. 499 to 502, except on a

complaint made by some persons aggrieved by such offence.",PREAMBLE

The section is mandatory, so 'that, if a Magistrate were to

take cognizance of the offence of defamation on a complaint

filed by one who is not an aggrieved person the trial and

conviction of the accused would be void and illegal.",PREAMBLE

(2)Section 499, I.P.C., defines defamation and lays down

that whoever by words, either spoken or intended to be read

or by signs etc., makes

or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending

to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that the

imputation will harm the reputation of such person is said

to defame that person.",PREAMBLE
2535,4243,3593,3754,"Explanation 2 to the section lays

down that it may amount to defamation to make an imputation

concerning a company or an association or collection of

persons.",PREAMBLE
2536,4243,3755,3969,"But such a collection of persons must be an

identifiable body, so, that, it is possible to say with

definiteness that a group of particular persons ,is

distinguished from the rest, of the community, was defamed.",PREAMBLE
2537,4243,3969,4187,"

Therefore, in a case where Explanation 2 is resorted to the

identify of the company or the association or the collection

of persons must be established so as to be relatable to the

defamatory words or imputations.",PREAMBLE
2538,4243,4188,4350,"If a well defined class is

defamed, every particular member' of that class can file a

complaint even if the defamatory imputation does not mention

him by name.",PREAMBLE

not would not be apt in a criminal prosecution where,",PREAMBLE

technically speaking, it is not by the persons injured but

by the state that criminal proceedings are carried on and a

complaint can. lie in a case of libel against a class of

persons provided always that such in class is not

indeterminate or 'indefinite but, a definite one.",PREAMBLE

no difference in principle between this rule of the Common

Law of England and the rule laid down in Explanation 2 to s.

(4)But in the present case, the conference was a body

distinct from the Dravida Kazhagam party.",PREAMBLE
2543,4243,5254,5445,"That the

conference was organised by the party would not mean that

both were the same or that the members of the party any

those of the conference or those who, attended it were the

same.",PREAMBLE
2544,4243,5446,5593,"In fact, the principal function of the reception

committee would be to enroll members of the conference and

collect funds to defray its expenses.",PREAMBLE

respondent also indicated that the conference was attended

not only by members of the Dravida Kazhagam party but also

by outsiders.",PREAMBLE

other or to say that a defamation of the conference as a

class or collection of persons was defamation of the Dravida

Kazhagam party.",PREAMBLE

that the resolution was by the conference and not by the

the Dravida Kazhagam was an identifiable group or not was
beside the point, for, what had to be decided was whether

That being so, the High Court completely missed the real issue, viz., whether the conference was a determinate and an identifiable body so that defamatory words used in relation to the resolution passed by it would be defamation of the individuals who composed it, and the respondent, as one such individuals and chairman of its reception committee could maintain a complaint under s. 500 of the Penal Code.",ANALYSIS

Whether the Dravida Kaghagam was an identifiable group or not was beside the point, for, what had to be decided was whether the conference which passed the resolution in question and which was said to have distorted was such a determinate body, like the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak in Tek Chand's case(',) or the body of public prosecutors in Sahib Singh Mehra's case(1) as to make defamation with respect to it a cause of complaint by its individual members.",ANALYSIS

2723,4286,2220,2291,3. The Plea of the defence is of outright denial and false implication.,FAC
2724,4286,2292,2363,4. The following points arose for determination in the present case: I.,ISSUE
2725,4286,2364,2624,"Whether on 09.12.2001at about 12.30 P.M. at Turiberna area, Munia Puran, the accused, was detected by the Excise officials to be in exclusive and conscious possession of one plastic jerrycane containing 10 litres of I.D liquor without any license or authority?",ISSUE
2726,4286,2626,2684,II. Whether the seized article was nothing but I.D liquor?,ISSUE
2727,4286,2686,2863,5. In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined 2 witnesses in all out of whom P.W. 1 is the independent witness to the seizure and Ext. 2 is the Excise constable.,FAC

2730,4286,3092,3266,6. The learned defence counsel has argued that the case is falsely foisted against the accused and no such occurrence took place to which the learned APP vehemently objected.,ARG_RESPONDENT
2731,4286,3268,3451,"7. On appreciation of evidence on record P.W.2, the Excise Constable has deposed that on 09.12.2001 he was performing patrolling duty at Turiberna area along with his official staffs.",FAC
2732,4286,3452,3565,During patrolling duty they detected one person with a plastic jerrycane which contained 10 litres of I.D liquor.,FAC

2734,4286,3656,3827,The independent witness examined in this case has deposed that he does not know anything about the present case and further stated that nothing was seized in his presence.,FAC
2735,4286,3828,3957,8. The next question to be determined is whether the seizure was made from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.,ANALYSIS
2736,4286,3958,4101,To this the learned counsel for the accused submitted that the independent witness available in this case did not prove the search and seizure.,ARG_RESPONDENT

2741,4286,4549,4660,"In the absence of independent corroboration, the search and seizure of the contraband articles become doubtful.",ANALYSIS
2742,4286,4661,4744,No documents relating to the ownership of the house were verified from the accused.,ANALYSIS
2743,4286,4745,4873,The possibility that her husband and other inmates might have possessed the same can not be ruled out in the facts of this case.,ANALYSIS

The story of the prosecution, in brief, is that on dated 13.11.2009 the informant Madhusudan Chhatria appeared at Kinjirkela PS and lodged a written report alleging therein that on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, when he was coming out of his house then the accused persons abused him in obscene words such as "" TU KI BANDAR MEMBER "" and also assaulted him as a result of which he sustained injuries on his person.",FAC

The petitioner is a registered dealer under the provisions of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (Hereinafter referred to as the `KVAT Act', for brevity) and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of rice bran oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil and soya oil, by employing solvent extraction process out of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake, and soya seeds.",FAC

2870,4082,2985,3272,"
 3. The first respondent audited the books of account for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 and had passed re-assessment orders under section 39(1) of the KVAT Act levying tax, penalty and interest.",ANALYSIS
2871,4082,3273,3587,"In doing so, the prescribed authority had allowed the partial input rebate as per Section 17 of the KVAT Act, on the value of inputs namely, rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seed used in the extraction of oil on the understanding of law that the petitioner is not eligible for full input tax rebate.",ANALYSIS
2872,4082,3587,4115,"
 4. Subsequent to the filing of the returns, a division bench of this court has rendered its judgment in M.K.Agro Tech Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka, 2014(18) KLJ 1, to the effect that when an assessee is in the business of manufacture of only one product, namely, oil and which is liable to tax, merely because in the process of manufacture of oil, certain by-product arises, which is sold and which is exempted from tax, that would not attract the provisions of Section 17 of the KVAT Act relating to partial rebate.",PRE_RELIED
2873,4082,4116,4292,"This was the declaratory of the law and according to the petitioner, would always have been applicable to all assessments made prior to and after the date of the said judgment.",ANALYSIS
2874,4082,4293,4627,"Therefore, the petitioner has filed an application under Section 69(1) relating to the tax period April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 before the first respondent, for rectification of the re-assessment orders and to grant full input tax rebate on the value of VAT.",ANALYSIS
2875,4082,4628,4920,"That was rejected only on the ground that the petitioner ought to have made a claim for full tax rebate in the first instance and no such claim having been made would preclude it from doing so, since such a claim could have been made only within a period of six months and not beyond that and",ANALYSIS
2876,4082,4921,5024,"hence, the question of considering the case of the petitioner for such full tax rebate would not arise.",ANALYSIS
2877,4082,5025,5293,"Insofar as the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, is concerned, it is applied in favour of the assesses from the date of judgment and there can be no second opinion, though the revenue has sought to challenge the same before the apex court and is pending consideration.",ANALYSIS
2878,4082,5295,5563,"5. The learned Government Advocate, while justifying the order, would submit that the question of rectification would not arise and it is a misconception on the part of the petitioner that they could file such a rectification application within a period of five years.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2879,4082,5564,6045,"Since the statute was clear even as on the date the claim was made and in the absence of any such claim, the petitioner now seeking to raise such a claim by hindsight, notwithstanding that it is only after the judgment was delivered by a division bench in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, in that, it has dawned on the petitioner that it could have made such an application, cannot be countenanced and seeks to contend that if any such benefit is given, the revenue would suffer serious loss.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2880,4082,6045,6406,"
 6. By way of reply, the learned Senior Advocate would point out that it is unfair on the part of the revenue to contend that such a claim should have been made in the first instance and that the petitioner is precluded from raising such a claim as on date, as it was a mutually understood position of law which prevented the assessees from raising such claim.",ARG_PETITIONER
2881,4082,6407,6765,"For otherwise, if such claim had been made, it was quite possible that they would have been penalized for making such a claim and it is only on the legal position being settled by a decision of a division bench of this court that the benefit available to the petitioner has dawned on the petitioner and therefore, the rectification application was justified.",ARG_PETITIONER
2882,4082,6767,7043,7. The point for consideration would be whether the petitioner could avail the benefit of the judgment which was rendered much after the assessment order was passed and whether such reassessment orders can be passed on their prayer for rectification of the earlier assessment.,ISSUE
2883,4082,7043,7608,"
 8. In the above circumstances, in a situation where if the revenue were to be in the position of the assessee and if it was discovered that by virtue of the operation of law, the revenue was entitled to a certain amount from the dealers, it would have certainly turned the tables on the assessee and proceeding on that presumption, it would be only just and fair to direct the revenue to consider the prayer of the petitioner for rectification, when there is no dispute that they were entitled to full tax rebate by virtue of the decision in M.K.Agro Tech, supra.",PRE_RELIED
2884,4082,7609,7749,It would be a formality for the respondent to pass a rectification order and grant full tax rebate to the petitioner in terms of its prayer.,ANALYSIS

 The respondent having challenged the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech,supra, before the apex court, there is no order of stay.",RPC
